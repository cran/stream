\details{
	For evaluation each data points are assigned
	to its nearest cluster using Euclidean distance to the cluster
	centers. Then for each cluster the majority class is determined. Based on 
  the majority class several 
	evaluation measures can be computed.
  
  For \code{evaluate_cluster} the most commonly used measure introduced 
  by Aggarwal et al (2003)
  is applied. The data points used for evaluation are taken from the previously 
  clustered horizon. Many evaluation measures are calculated with code from the
  packages \pkg{cluster}, \pkg{clue} and \pkg{fpc}. Detailed documentation can 
  be found in these packages (see Section See Also.)
  
  The following information items are available:  
	\itemize{
		\item	\code{"numMicroClusters"} number of micro-clusters
    \item \code{"numMacroClusters"} number of macro-clusters 
		\item	\code{"numClasses"} number of classes
	}
  
  The following internal evaluation measures are available:
	\itemize{
		\item	\code{"SSQ"} sum of squares (actual noise points are excluded) 
		\item	\code{"silhouette"} average silhouette width (points that are actual noise and 
      predicted to be noise are excluded) (\pkg{cluster}) 
	  \item \code{"average.between"} average distance between clusters (\pkg{fpc})        
	  \item \code{"average.within"} average distance within clusters (\pkg{fpc})          
	  \item \code{"max.diameter"} maximum cluster diameter (\pkg{fpc})    
	  \item \code{ "min.separation"} minimum cluster separation (\pkg{fpc})
	  \item \code{"ave.within.cluster.ss"} a generalization of the within clusters sum of squares (half the sum of the within cluster squared dissimilarities divided by the cluster size) (\pkg{fpc})
	  \item \code{"g2"} Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma coefficient (\pkg{fpc}) 
    \item \code{"pearsongamma"} correlation between distances and a 0-1-vector where 0 means same cluster, 1 means different clusters (\pkg{fpc})
	  \item \code{"dunn"} Dunn index (minimum separation / maximum diameter) (\pkg{fpc}) 
    \item \code{"dunn2"} minimum average dissimilarity between two cluster / maximum average within cluster dissimilarity (\pkg{fpc}) 
	  \item \code{"entropy"} entropy of the distribution of cluster memberships (\pkg{fpc}) 
    \item \code{"wb.ratio"} average.within/average.between (\pkg{fpc})
	}  

  The following external evaluation measures are available:
  \itemize{
		\item	\code{"precision"}, \code{"recall"}, \code{"F1"} F1.
     A true positive (TP) decision assigns two points in the same
                true cluster also to the same cluster,
                a true negative (TN) decision assigns two points from two
                different true clusters to two different clusters.
                A false positive (FP) decision assigns two points from the
                same true cluster to two different clusters.
                A false negative (FN) decision assigns two points from the
                same true cluster to different clusters.

                precision = TP/(TP+FP)
                
                recall = TP/(TP+FN)

                The F1 measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
                
		\item	\code{"purity"}  Average purity of clusters. The purity of each cluster
        is the proportion of the points of the majority true group assigned to it
        (see Cao et al. (2006))
%		\item	\code{"classPurity"} (of real clusters; see Wan et al (2009)), 
%		\item	\code{"fpr"} false positive rate,
		\item	\code{"Euclidean"} Euclidean dissimilarity of
		          the memberships (see Dimitriadou, Weingessel and Hornik
			            (2002)) (\pkg{clue}) 
		\item	\code{"Manhattan"} Manhattan dissimilarity of
		          the memberships (\pkg{clue}) 
		\item	\code{"Rand"} Rand index (see Rand (1971)) (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"cRand"} Adjusted Rand index (see Hubert and Arabie (1985)) (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"NMI"} Normalized Mutual Information (see Strehl and Ghosh
		          (2002)) (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"KP"} Katz-Powell index (see Katz and
		          Powell (1953)) (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"angle"} maximal cosine of the angle between the agreements (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"diag"} maximal co-classification rate (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"FM"} Fowlkes and Mallows's index (see Fowlkes and Mallows (1983)) (\pkg{clue})
		\item	\code{"Jaccard"} Jaccard index (\pkg{clue}) 
		\item	\code{"PS"} Prediction Strength (see Tibshirani and Walter (2005)) (\pkg{clue})
	%  \item  \code{"corrected.rand"} corrected Rand index (\pkg{fpc})
	  \item  \code{"vi"} 	variation of information (VI) index (\pkg{fpc})
}

Many measures are the average over all clusters. For example, purity is
the average purity over all clusters.

For \code{DSC_Micro} objects, data points are assigned to micro-clusters
and then each micro-cluster is evaluated. For \code{DSC_Macro} objects, 
data points by default (\code{assign="micro"}) also assigned to
micro-clusters, but these assignments are translated to macro-clusters.
The evaluation is here done for macro-clusters. This is important when 
macro-clustering is done with algorithms which do not create spherical
clusters (e.g, hierarchical clustering with single-linkage or DBSCAN) and
this assignment to the macro-clusters directly (i.e., their center) 
does not make sense.

Using \code{type} and \code{assign}, the user can select how to assign data
points and ad what level (micro or macro) to evaluate.

Many of the above measures are implemented package \pkg{clue} in function
\code{cl_agreement().}

\code{evaluate_cluster()} is used to evaluate an evolving data stream using
the method described by Wan et al. (2009). Of the \code{n} data points
\code{horizon} many points are clustered and then the evaluation
measure is calculated on the same data points. The idea is to find out if 
the clustering algorithm was able to adapt to the changing stream.

\value{
    \code{evaluate} returns an object of class \code{stream_eval}
    which is a numeric vector of the values of the requested measures
    and two attributes, \code{"type"} and
    \code{"assign"}, to see at what level the evaluation was done.
